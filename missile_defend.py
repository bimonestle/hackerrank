# Evil Nation A is angry and plans to launch N guided-missiles
# at the peaceful Nation B in an attempt to wipe out all of Nation B's people.
# Nation A's missile 'i' will arrive in nation B at time 'ti'.
# Missile 'i' communicates with its headquarters by unique radio signals with a
# frequency equal to 'fi'. Can you help the peaceful Nation B survive by building
# a defensive system that will stop the missiles dead in the sky?

# The only way to defend Nation B from the attacking missile is by counter attacking them
# with a hackerX missile. You have a lot of hackerX missiles and each one of them has its own radio frequency.
# An individual hackerX missile can destroy Evil Nation Aâ€™s attacking missile if the radio frequency
# of both of the missiles match. Each hackerX missile can be used an indefinite number of times.
# Its invincible and doesn't get destroyed in the collision.

# The good news is you can adjust the frequency of the hackerX missile to match
# the evil missiles' frequency. When changing the hackerX missile's initial frequency fA
# to the new defending frequency fB, you will need \|fB - fA\| units of time to do.

# If two evil missles with same frequency arrive at the same time,
# we can destroy them both with one hackerX missile.
# You can set the frequency of a hackerX missile to any value when its fired.

# What is the minimum number of hackerX missiles you must launch to keep Nation B safe?

# Input Format:
# The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of missiles.
# This is followed by N lines each containing two integers ti and fi denoting the time & frequency of the ith missile.

# Output Format:
# A single integer denoting the minimum number of hackerX missiles you need to defend the nation.

# SAMPLE INPUT #00
# 4
# 1 1
# 2 2
# 3 1
# 5 1
# Output: 1

# EXPLANATION #00
# A HackerX missile is launched at t = 1 with a frequency f = 1, and destroys the first missile.
# It re-tunes its frequency to f = 2 in 1 unit of time, and destroys the missile that is going to hit Nation B at t = 2.
# It re-tunes its frequency back to 1 in 1 unit of time and destroys the missile that is going to hit the nation at t = 3.
# It is relaunched at t = 5 with f = 1 and destroys the missile that is going to hit nation B at t = 5.
# Hence, you need only 1 HackerX to protect nation B.

# SAMPLE INPUT #01
# 4
# 1 1
# 2 3
# 3 1
# 5 1
# Output: 2

# EXPLANATION #01
# Destroy 1 missile at t = 1, f = 1. now at t = 2, there is a missile with frequency 3.
# The launched missile takes 2 units of time to destroy this, hence we need a new hackerX missile to destroy this one.
# The first hackerX missile can destroy the 3rd missile which has the same frequency as itself.
# The same hackerX missile destroys the missile that is hitting its city at t = 5. Thus, we need atleast 2 hackerX missiles.
